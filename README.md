## Modules Present In Project
### 1. [Diabetes](https://github.com/i-sanjay-cs/Doctor_AI/tree/1164e9505cef6dd58a0bee5ec9783820d09beeee/Diabetes)
    Random Forest and XGBoost are two powerful machine learning algorithms that can be applied to a diabetes prediction project.
    Both algorithms are widely used for classification tasks and can be instrumental in analyzing diabetes-related data to make accurate predictions.

### 2.[Multiple Disease](https://github.com/i-sanjay-cs/Doctor_AI/tree/1164e9505cef6dd58a0bee5ec9783820d09beeee/Multiple%20Diseases)
#### Heart Disease:- 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular machine learning algorithm that can be applied to the task of predicting heart disease. 
SVMs are effective for both classification and regression tasks, and they are well-suited for binary classification problems like 
predicting the presence or  absence of heart disease

#### Parkinson's:-
Using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for Parkinson's disease classification can be an effective approach. 
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for binary classification tasks.
